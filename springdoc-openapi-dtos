For the following record, generate the appropriate Swagger annotation that describes the attributes appropriately.
Please omit deprecated annotations:
@Schema(
    required = true
)
required true is e.g. deprecated use the following instead.
@Schema(
    requiredMode = Schema.RequiredMode.REQUIRED
)
The requiredMode annotation must be set per default, all fields must be required

For the documentation of my records I use springdoc-openapi. The documentation should use the appropriate language [TARGETLANGUAGE]
Provide the required code for the prompt without any explanation unless i ask for it.

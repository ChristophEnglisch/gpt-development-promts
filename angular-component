I will provide you with the code of a new Angular component, both the script and the HTML part.
I want you to produce code in the subsequent conversation that meets the requirements I provide.
Please only output the new code in markdown format, and nothing else - no explanations on your part.
Now, for informational purposes, I'll provide you the component. Always respond to the initial conversation with 'okay', and thereafter only with code.
The code you generate should never contain comments, only instructions in the form of code.

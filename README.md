# GPT-Prompts for Workflow Reusability

Welcome to the repository containing GPT prompts for facilitating the reuse of fixed workflows. By leveraging the power of Chat GPT, this repository aims to help developers and other users swiftly incorporate repetitive tasks, coding routines, and other similar workflows.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the prompts.
3. Use the prompts as a template or reference when communicating with GPT-based models.

## Example Prompt

```
I will provide you with the code of a new Angular component, both the script and the HTML part.
I want you to produce code in the subsequent conversation that meets the requirements I provide.
Please only output the new code in markdown format, and nothing else - no explanations on your part.
Now, for informational purposes, I'll provide you the component. Always respond to the initial conversation with 'okay', and thereafter only with code.
The code you generate should never contain comments, only instructions in the form of code.
```

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Start with the provided example or tailor the prompt to fit your specific workflow.
2. **Interaction**: When communicating with the GPT-based model, follow the structure of the prompt. Begin with an introduction, provide your requirements, and then give the necessary information.
